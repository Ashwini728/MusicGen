## Features

### 🔥 Core Features
- **Mood-based playlist generation** – happy, sad, romantic, energetic, chill, etc.
- **Activity-based playlists** – study, workout, travel, sleep, party.
- **Smart recommendation engine** using audio embeddings + similarity search.
- **Playlist refinement** – remove unwanted songs or regenerate sections.
- **User history learning** – system improves over time based on preferences.

## Under the Hood (AI)
- Extracts **YAMNet audio embeddings** from tracks.
- Stores embeddings in **Pinecone vector database** for fast retrieval.
- Uses **cosine similarity search** to recommend the closest songs.
- Optional **Random Forest ranking model** to enhance playlist quality.

##  How It Works

1. User selects **mood**, **activity**, or enters a **custom prompt**.  
2. System converts the query into an **embedding vector**.  
3. Vector similarity search retrieves the closest matching songs.  
4. Playlist is generated with metadata (genre, artist, tempo).  
5. User can save, regenerate, or fine-tune the playlist.
